GAME MECHANICS:

YOUR GOAL IS TO KILL THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF ENEMY TANKS PER STAGE
WHILST PROTECTING THE HOME CELL. IF ANY BULLET HITS THE HOME CELL,
THE GAME ENDS AND YOU LOSE. YOU HAVE 2 LIVES TO WORK WITH. 
WHEN AN ENEMY BULLET HITS YOU, YOU LOSE 1 LIFE.

THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ENEMY TANKS. THE DARK RED ENEMY TANK IS THE NORMAL
ENEMY TANK. THE LIGHTER RED TANK TAKES TWO HITS FROM THE PLAYER TO BE DESTROYED. 
ENEMY TANKS SPAWN PERIODICALLY EACH STAGE.

THERE ARE 8 TYPES OF CELLES. TANKS CAN PASS THROUGH OPEN CELLS.
THE BRICK CELLS TURN TO A CRACKED BRICK CELL AFTER 1 HIT.
AFTER ANOTHER HIT, ITS BROKEN. WATER CELLS CAN HAVE BULLETS GO PAST THROUGH THEM
BUT NO ENEMY OR PLAYER CAN PASS THROUGH IT. FOREST CELLS ARE LIKE EMPTY CELLS BUT 
PARTIALLY BLOCKS THE PLAYER TANK. MIRROR CELLS (LEFT AND RIGHT) REFLECT/BOUNCE BULLETS,
ALLOWING FRIENDLY FIRE TO OCCUR. STONE CELLS ARE IMPASSABLE FOR BULLETS, PLAYER, AND ENEMIES. 
THE POWER-UP CELL WILL POP-UP AFTER YOU HAVE DESTROYED HALF OF THE REQUIRED ENEMIES FOR THE STAGE. 
THE POWER-UP FREEZES ALL ENEMY SPAWNING AND MOVEMENTS FOR AROUND 10 SECONDS. TO COLLECT THE POWER-UP, 
PASS THE PLAYER THROUGH THE POWER-UP CELL. ONLY ONE PLAYER BULLET CAN BE FIRED AT A TIME. BULLETS 
FROM THE PLAYER AND ENEMIES THAT COLLIDE WILL BE DESTROYED.

STAGE FILE FORMAT:

THE STAGE FILE USES THE CSV FILE FORMAT. SPECS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF STAGES,
THE NUMBER OF TANKS NEEDED TO BE DESTROYED PER STAGE, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
THE STAGE LAYOUT, WHICH INCLUDES THE POSITION OF THE PLAYER TANK, THE SPAWN POINTS
FOR ENEMY TANKS, AND THE PLACEMENT OF OTHER CELL TYPES.

HOW TO LOAD:

UPON RUNNING THE SOURCE CODE (MAIN.PY), IT ASKS THE USER TO ENTER THE FILE NAME OF THE STAGE FILE.
AFTER INPUTTING THE FILE NAME IN THE TERMINAL, THE GAME WILL LOAD THE STAGE FILE.
